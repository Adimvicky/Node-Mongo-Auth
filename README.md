# Node-Mongo-Auth
A NodeJS, MongoDB  user authenication boilerplate to fit all use cases!

This is a MEN stack user authentication boilerplate on which you can build for your web apps depending on the use case.
To get the app running on your local machine, you must have MongoDB and Node.js installed!
Go ahead and clone this repository here on github to get it on your machine. Alternatively, you could run :
$ git clone https://github.com/Adimvicky/Node-Mongo-Auth on your terminal.
Next, cd into the project folder and run : 
$ npm install
.. that would install all the packages required.
Be sure to have your MongoDB server and Mongo shell running in different terminals, before running :
$ node app.js
..aaaaand you are all set! The app is running on your localhost (port 3000).

Please leave a comment if there's something i should change or improve on! 
P.S you can go ahead and do away with the css file
